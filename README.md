# DRB-Analysis
This is part of an analysis of Air Force Discharge Review Board (DRB) Cases

This is a work in progress.

These files are part of an analysis of Discharge Review Board Cases before the Air Force DRB. The information is necessarily fuzzy because the underlying information relies wholly on publicly disclosed files from the DRB which can be found for each branch here https://boards.law.af.mil/. The disclosed files are heavily paired down and only provide about a one-page summary decision. Further, even the summaries that are available are limited in size such that many summaries are only partially available. Thus, any inferences made from this analysis is constrained by those issues in the underlying information. These analyses should not be relied on for more than a cursory examination of possible trends or areas for future research.
